# Stress-Free Disneyland Paris Transfers for Large Families and Groups

Planning a magical trip to Disneyland Paris with a large family or a group of friends sounds exciting—but let’s be honest, the logistics can get complicated fast. When you're traveling with 9 to 45 people, from airports like Charles de Gaulle (CDG), Orly, or Beauvais, you need more than just a ride. You need coordination, space, and above all, comfort.

In this article, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about organizing **group transfers to Disneyland Paris**, how to avoid the common headaches, and why private transport is the smartest choice.

## Why Group Transfers Need Special Planning

While individual travelers can hop on a train or grab a taxi, large families and organized groups face a completely different reality:

- Public transportation becomes unrealistic  
- Taxis only fit 3 to 4 passengers  
- Managing luggage for 10+ people is chaotic  
- Staying together during transfers is nearly impossible  

Whether you're coming for a birthday, a school trip, or a family reunion, you deserve a solution that fits your group’s specific needs.
