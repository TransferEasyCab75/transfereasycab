## 🚗 Transfer Options: How to Get from CDG to Disneyland Paris

There are multiple ways to make the journey from Charles de Gaulle to Disneyland Paris. Below are the most popular options:

### 1. **Public Transport (RER + TGV)**

- **Duration**: 45–75 minutes  
- **Cost**: €17 – €30 per person

Public transportation may be budget-friendly, but it involves navigating terminals, stairs, and ticket machines — a challenge for families with kids or heavy luggage.

### 2. **Shared Shuttle Services**

- **Duration**: 60–120 minutes  
- **Cost**: €30 – €40 per person

- **Cost**: €75 – €100

Taxis don't offer door-to-door service, they’re not always consistent in quality, pricing, or availability. Not all drivers speak English or offer child seats.

### 4. **Private Transfers** (Best Option in 2025)

- **Duration**: 40–50 minutes  
- **Cost**: €80 – €120 per ride (not per person)

Private transfers provide **stress-free, fixed-price** transportation directly to your hotel. Services like [Transfer Easy Cab](https://www.transfereasycab.com) offer multi-lingual drivers, luxury vehicles, baby seats, free Wi-Fi, and custom pick-up times.
