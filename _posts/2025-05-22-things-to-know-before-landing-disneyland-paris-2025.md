# 5 Things to Know Before Landing in Paris for Your Disneyland Trip (2025)

You've booked your Disneyland Paris vacation, the kids are excited, and your flight is coming up soon. But before you land in Paris, there are a few key things to know that can save you stress and ensure your trip starts smoothly.

This article covers the top 5 things first-time visitors often overlook — and how to avoid them.

## 1. Paris Has 3 Airports — Know Which One You're Using

Make sure you know where you're landing, because not all airports are equal when it comes to reaching Disneyland Paris.

- **Charles de Gaulle (CDG)** – Main international airport, ~45 km to Disneyland
- **Orly (ORY)** – South of Paris, ~50 km from the parks
- **Beauvais (BVA)** – Used by low-cost airlines, ~120 km away (longest transfer time)

📍 Knowing your arrival airport helps you book the right transfer in advance.

## 2. Don't Wait to Book Your Airport Transfer

Thinking of grabbing a taxi at the airport? That can be risky.

- Long queues, especially at CDG
- No child seats guaranteed
- Language barriers with drivers
- Surge pricing or unclear costs

### ✅ Best solution:
**Pre-book a private transfer** with a service like [Transfer Easy Cab](https://www.transfereasycab.com/paris-disney-transfer). Benefits include:

- Fixed price
- Flight tracking
- Meet-and-greet at arrivals with a sign
- Free child seats on request
- Multilingual driver support (English, French, Spanish)

Start your trip stress-free.

## 3. Hotel or Airbnb Location Impacts Your Trip

Where you stay affects how you get to Disneyland:

- 🏨 Staying in Paris? Expect a 45–60 min drive to the park
- 🏰 Going straight to a Disney hotel? 40–50 mins from CDG
- 🗺️ Airbnb in Marne-la-Vallée? Provide exact address for efficient pickup

✅ Private transfers pick you up or drop you off at **any address**, not just hotels or train stations.

## 4. Know What to Expect After You Land

Once your plane touches down:

- Passport control: 15–45 minutes
- Baggage claim: 5–20 minutes
- Then you'll enter the arrivals hall

With **Transfer Easy Cab**, your driver waits in the arrivals area holding a sign and tracks your flight. You'll also receive a **WhatsApp message upon landing**.

No app searching, no guessing, no delays.

## 5. Prepare to Hit the Park Running

If you plan to go directly from the airport to Disneyland Paris:

- ✅ Download the Disneyland Paris app for real-time schedules and maps
- ✅ Reserve your park tickets and Premier Access ahead of time
- ✅ Dress in layers — Paris weather is unpredictable
- ✅ Ask your driver to drop luggage at your hotel reception before the park (most allow this)

➡️ Private transfers are flexible and can stop at your hotel on the way to the park entrance.

## ✨ Final Tip: Book Smart, Travel Easy

Most travelers focus on tickets and rides — but **the first 2 hours after landing** set the tone for your entire trip.

Avoid confusion, delays, and stress by booking your **Disneyland Paris transfer** ahead of time.
